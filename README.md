This program is a system for detecting traffic lights
in given pictures. 
At the beginning the system finds candidates to be traffic 
lights using convolution. The second step is finding
which of the lights is traffic light by neural network.
The system contains trained neural network (and code
to build it in comment). 
In The last step the system finds the distance between 
the camera and the traffic light.

You can run the program from controller.py
